               <dt>Growing Up</dt><br>
                    <dd>I grew up having a passion for animals and I had always imagined that my job would involve working with them. When I was in highschool I volunteered with the Missouri Department of Conservation and the Kansas City Zoo. I devoted, practically, all of my time outside of school to spend volunteering and I loved every mintute of it. I'm thankful for those expierences I was so lucky to have, they are some of my favorite memories! When I started college I fully intended on studying to become a zoologist, but quickly learned that I didn't want to spend the rest of my life doing that.

             <dt>When I Discovered Photography</dt><br>
                 <dd>In highschool I loved attending concerts and I would sit outside the venue hours before some shows just so I could get barricade for my favorite artists. I remember noticing that there were people taking photos of all the shows I would go to and I decided I wanted to do that too. I bought my first DSLR camera a few months later and off I went. That was three years ago and since then I've realized that my passion is for photography. What I love most about concert photography is how fast paced everything is. Things are always changing, one moment is never the same from the last. I can feel the energy in the room and everyone's excitment. Watching the crowd and the artists ineract is the coolest thing and I'm happy to be able to be apart of that.

                    <dt>What's Happening Now</dt><br>
                     <dd>Photography is something I have always enjoyed and I'm lucky that I've been able to find my passion for it so early in life.  I love showing the world through my viewpoint and capturing each subjects personality.  Since the pandemic started I have not been to a single concert, which is almost painful to say. However it has pushed me to experiement with other things and learn more. In the last year I've learned that I love doing portraits of people and capturing who they really are. Seeing others light up and become confident in themselves is a special moment I'm honored to be apart of.
